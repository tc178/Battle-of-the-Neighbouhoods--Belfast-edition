Since the release of Game of Thrones, most of which is shot in Northern Ireland, tourism to my home country has only grown over the recent years: “Figures from Tourism NI, the region's tourism development body, paint a similarly upbeat picture. They suggest that 350,000 people come to Northern Ireland every year just for Game of Thrones - that is one in six leisure visitors. It is estimated they spend £50m each year.” [1]. \nThis, alongside the newly developed Titanic museum in 2013 attracts a huge number of visitors every year- 837,000 in 2018 [3], which just shows how interest and popularity of Northern Ireland are only increasing every year. \nGiven these, combined with Belfasts relatively low population- 630,000 [2]; this would be an excellent city to open a new hotel in.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Business Problem:","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"While this is no doubt an excellent time and opportunity to open a business to cater for the incoming tourists; the question remains, where should someone open a hotel to provide accommodation for these guests?\nThe target audience for this problem, is going to be any possible hotel developer- let’s take Domus UK Ltd as an example.

We will make use of, but not limited to the following examples for various neighbourhoods:\n-\tWhich area has the most/least hotels\n-\tWhich hotels have the highest ratings\n-\tPrice of the local hotels\n-\tWhat each location has to offer for guests.
