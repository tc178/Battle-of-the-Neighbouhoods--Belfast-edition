Since the release of Game of Thrones, most of which is shot in Northern Ireland, tourism to my home country has only grown over the recent years: “Figures from Tourism NI, the region's tourism development body, paint a similarly upbeat picture. They suggest that 350,000 people come to Northern Ireland every year just for Game of Thrones - that is one in six leisure visitors. It is estimated they spend £50m each year.” [1]. \nThis, alongside the newly developed Titanic museum in 2013 attracts a huge number of visitors every year- 837,000 in 2018 [3], which just shows how interest and popularity of Northern Ireland are only increasing every year. \nGiven these, combined with Belfasts relatively low population- 630,000 [2]; this would be an excellent city to open a new hotel in.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Business Problem:","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"While this is no doubt an excellent time and opportunity to open a business to cater for the incoming tourists; the question remains, where should someone (say John) open a hotel to provide accommodation for these guests?\nBelfast is made up of 18 Postcodes, all of which offer already existing different attractions/entertainment/restaurants. Therefore the best method for John to decide which area to open a hotel in, is to explore the locational data behind each postcode, to see what each neighbourhood has to offer. Using this data, John can then make a well informed decision, which should maximise the profit of this business venture. \n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## The Data:","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Now that John has the problem and the business opportunity outlined, how is he going to solve this using data? Fortunately Belfast has a wealth of business and corresponding locational data. Belfast is split up into 18 postcodes, with each district and location providing a range of restaurants/bars/entertainment. We can therefore use foursquares locational data, analyse the different Districts/Neighbourhoods to see which area offers the most/least competition to open a hotel; meanwhile analysing each neighbourhood to see what they offer to attract and entertain hotel guests in the nearby area.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## References:","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"[1] \thttps://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-48343910\n\n[2]\thttps://worldpopulationreview.com/world-cities/belfast-population/\n\n[3] \thttps://www.statista.com/statistics/649119/titanic-belfast-visitor-numbers-northern-ireland-uk/\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
